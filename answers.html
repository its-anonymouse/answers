      4. What do you think is important, eating healthy or doing exercise? Why?
    </h2>
    The importance of eating healthy and exercising is interlinked, each playing
    a unique role in overall well-being. A nutritious diet provides essential
    nutrients for bodily functions, energy, and disease prevention. Meanwhile,

    contributes to mental health. Together, they form a powerful synergy,
    enhancing the benefits of one another. While both are vital, striking a
    balance is key. A well-rounded approach that combines healthy eating habits
    with regular physical activity establishes a solid foundation for a
    healthier, more robust life.

    fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and dairy or dairy
    alternatives. Portion control is crucial to avoid overeating, and mindful
    eating helps develop a healthy relationship with food. Regular
    self-assessment and adjustments ensure that your diet meets nutritional
    needs. Being conscious of food choices and making informed decisions
    contribute to maintaining a balanced diet, supporting overall health and
    well-being in the long run.
